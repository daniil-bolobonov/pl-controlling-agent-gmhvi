## Basic Setup

- [ ] Read the project input (`product-requirements-document.md`, `intent.md`, or the user prompt that triggered this specification)
- [ ] Run `pwd` and store the output as `working_directory`
- [ ] Invoke the `data-product` skill to execute the workflow from **Step 1a** (search and selection were completed during `intent-analysis` — do not re-run them). Pass the confirmed Data Product ORD ID(s) from `intent.md` as the input DP selection already in context.

## Testing
